# SNMPede

SNMPede (SNMP + Centipede) is a pure Python wrapper script around the [PySNMP](https://www.pysnmp.com) project built to simplify attacking SNMP versions 1, 2c, and 3 across IPv4/6 systems. This tool works on any system supporting at least Python 3.9 such as most modern day Windows and Linux operating systems.

## Features

The following features are built into SNMPede:

- Authenticated Versioning (v1/2c/3)
- Spraying of Community Strings (v1/2c)
- Spraying usernames with NoAuthNoPriv (v3)
- Spraying username/password/protocol with AuthNoPriv (v3)
- Spraying username/passwords/protocols with AuthPriv (v3)
- BulkWalk of entire SNMP agents (v2c/v3)

```cmd
usage: snmpede.py [-h] [-c COMMUNITY] [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] [--bulkwalk] [--all] [-t TARGET] [-pt PORT]
                  [-i INTERFACE] [-eid ENGINE_ID] [-o OUTPUT] [-d {0,1,2}] [-to TIMEOUT] [-rt RETRIES] [-dl DELAY]
                  [-or OID_READ] [-tk TASKS]

A modern and intelligent approach to SNMP hacking

optional arguments:

  --bulkwalk            Collect as much information as possible
  --all                 CAUTION: Use all above modules and default login dictionaries

I/O Arguments:

  -i INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
                        Specify network interface (e.g., eth0, Ethernet0)
  -eid ENGINE_ID, --engine-id ENGINE_ID
                        Specify a hex agent engine ID (e.g., 0x80000000011234567890abcdef)
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        CSV prepended output filename/path
  -d {0,1,2}, --debug {0,1,2}
                        Debug level to stdout
  -to TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT
                        Timeout seconds
  -rt RETRIES, --retries RETRIES
                        Retries count
  -dl DELAY, --delay DELAY
                        Seconds delay between each request
  -or OID_READ, --oid-read OID_READ
                        OID the Login module will read (default is sysDescr.0)
  -tk TASKS, --tasks TASKS
                        Number of concurrent tasks
```

## Installation

To install the tool, install/upgrade these various packages:

```cmd
python -m pip install -r 'requirements.txt'
```

## Usage

Please note that if you are only using the Post-Exploitation features, we will still check to see if your authentication is valid prior. See the module usages below:

### All

This selection will:

1. Spray v1/2c community strings
2. Spray v3 usernames (NoAuthNoPriv)
3. Spray v3 usernames and authentication passwords/algorithms (AuthNoPriv)
4. Spray v3 usernames, authentication passwords/algorithms, and privacy passwords/algorithms (AuthPriv)
5. BulkWalk any successfully accessed SNMP agents

```cmd
python SNMPede.py --all -t 'targets.txt' -c 'Dictionaries/Community_Strings.txt' -u 'Dictionaries/Usernames.txt' -p 'Dictionaries/Passwords.txt'
```

### Spray: Community Strings

```cmd
python SNMPede.py -t 'targets.txt' -c 'Dictionaries/Community_Strings.txt'
```

### Spray: Passwords

This selection will:

1. Spray usernames (NoAuthNoPriv)
2. Spray usernames and authentication passwords/algorithms (AuthNoPriv)
3. Spray usernames, authentication passwords/algorithms, and privacy passwords/algorithms (AuthPriv)

```cmd
python SNMPede.py -t 'targets.txt' -u 'Dictionaries/Usernames.txt' -p 'Dictionaries/Passwords.txt'
```

## Existing Research

Throughout history, many amazing SNMP tools have been created, but were often:

- Too specific in their hacking scope
- Were meant for system administration purposes only
- Misled users on how SNMP versioning and authentication works
- Were operating system specific or language-restricting

That said, we appreciate all the help these tools have introduced to the InfoSec community in teaching IT administrators better SNMP security!
